# Anti-Spam & Leaderboard Implementation

## Problem Solved ‚úÖ

**Original Issue**: Users could spam chat messages infinitely to farm XP and convert to free credits.

**Solution**: Multi-layered spam prevention + competitive leaderboard for engagement.

## üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Spam Protection

### Chat XP Rate Limiting
```
Max 100 XP per day from chat messages
= 50 messages at 2 XP each (or 25 with 2√ó streak)
```

**How It Works:**
1. Every chat message XP gain is logged to `xp_log` table
2. Before awarding XP, system queries today's total chat XP
3. If user has earned 100 XP from chat today ‚Üí no more XP
4. User can still chat (not blocked), just doesn't earn XP
5. Resets at midnight UTC

**Database Query:**
```sql
SELECT SUM(amount) AS total 
FROM xp_log 
WHERE user = $rid 
  AND day = '2025-10-01'  -- today
  AND reason = 'chat-message';
```

### Why 100 XP Cap?
- Prevents infinite credit farming
- Still rewards active participation (50 messages/day is substantial)
- With 2√ó streak: 25 messages = cap (reasonable engagement)
- Doesn't punish legitimate users

## üèÜ XP Leaderboard

### New Channel: "XP Leaderboard"
Located in Showroom sidebar as a special channel.

**Access:**
- Read: Pro plan users
- Write: Admin only (prevents spam/clutter)

**Features:**
- Top 50 XP earners
- Special badges for top 3:
  - üèÜ #1: Gold gradient
  - ü•à #2: Silver gradient  
  - ü•â #3: Bronze gradient
- Current user highlighted with ring
- Rank shown if outside top 50
- Auto-refreshes on XP events

### Leaderboard API
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/xp/leaderboard`

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "leaderboard": [
    {
      "rank": 1,
      "name": "Alex Hormozi",
      "email": "alex@example.com",
      "xp": 50000,
      "level": 22,
      "isMe": false
    }
    // ... up to 50 entries
  ],
  "myRank": 127  // Only if user is outside top 50
}
```

**Performance:**
- Simple ORDER BY xp DESC LIMIT 50
- Fast with index on user.xp
- Could cache for 5min if needed

## üéâ First Post Milestone

### Enhanced First Post Experience

**Before:**
- First post = +50 XP (same as all posts)
- No special recognition

**After:**
- First post = +100 XP (2√ó bonus)
- Special toast with:
  - üéâ Party emoji (larger)
  - "First Post Bonus!" title
  - Emerald/teal gradient
  - "Welcome to the Showroom" message
  - 5 second duration (longer than normal)
  - Pulse animation on icon

**Detection:**
```typescript
// Check if user has any prior showroom-post XP logs
SELECT id FROM xp_log 
WHERE user = $rid 
  AND reason = 'showroom-post' 
LIMIT 1;

if (no results) {
  isFirstPost = true;
  add = 100;  // Double the normal 50 XP
}
```

### Why Toast (Not Drawer)?
Per your question earlier about drawer vs toast:

**Toast is better for first post because:**
- Immediate gratification during active posting
- Doesn't interrupt posting flow
- Visual enough to feel special
- Can post multiple images back-to-back
- Drawer would feel disruptive mid-activity

**Drawer reserved for:**
- Level-ups (pause-worthy milestones)
- Daily bonus (start of session)
- Major achievements

## üîí Security Measures

### XP Farming Prevention

**Attack Vector 1: Chat Spam**
- ‚ùå Before: Unlimited 2 XP per message
- ‚úÖ After: 100 XP daily cap

**Attack Vector 2: Multiple First Posts**
- ‚ùå Before: Not implemented (would be exploitable)
- ‚úÖ After: Tracked in xp_log, only awards once

**Attack Vector 3: XP Redemption Abuse**
- ‚úÖ Tracks xp_redeemed separately
- ‚úÖ Can't redeem same XP twice
- ‚úÖ Validates availableXp = totalXp - redeemedXp

**Attack Vector 4: Fake Streak Multiplier**
- ‚úÖ Calculated server-side from activity table
- ‚úÖ Can't be spoofed from client

### Data Integrity

**xp_log Table Purpose:**
1. **Rate limiting** - Daily aggregation for caps
2. **Analytics** - Track earning patterns
3. **Audit trail** - Verify legitimate XP gains
4. **Anti-cheating** - Detect anomalies

**Schema:**
```sql
xp_log {
  user: RecordId<"user">,
  amount: number,         -- XP awarded
  reason: string,         -- activity type
  day: string,           -- 'YYYY-MM-DD'
  created_at: datetime
}
```

## üéÆ Competitive Psychology

### Why Leaderboard Works

From Hormozi's Skool implementation:
> "Real-time leaderboards... turn growth into a game with status and recognition"

**Psychological Triggers:**
1. **Social Comparison** - "I'm #47, I can hit #40"
2. **Status Seeking** - Top 3 badges create aspiration
3. **Loss Aversion** - Don't want to drop in rank
4. **Achievement Visibility** - Public validation of effort

### Leaderboard Design Decisions

**Top 50 Only (Not 100)**
- Creates exclusivity
- "Breaking into top 50" feels achievable
- Keeps UI clean and performant

**Read-Only Channel**
- Focus on competition, not conversation
- No spam/clutter
- Could add admin announcements for XP events

**Live Updates**
- Listens to `xp-refresh` events
- Shows rank changes in real-time
- Gamifies the grind

## Hormozi Quote That Guided This

> *"Customers would start any offer if I made it tasty enough. But, they'd only stick if they had good reasons to. So I gave them one‚Ä¶ every 14 days. A good offer got them to start, and good bonuses got them to stick."*

**Our Application:**
- **Offer to start**: First post bonus (100 XP)
- **Bonuses to stick**: Daily login, streak multiplier, leaderboard status
- **Frequency**: Daily rewards (better than 14 days)
- **Result**: Habitual engagement

---

## Next Implementation Phase (When Ready)

Based on Hormozi framework, prioritize:

1. **Named Level Titles** (1-2 hours) - Highest psychological impact
2. **Public Level Announcements** (2 hours) - Social proof
3. **Variable XP Events** (3-4 hours) - Surprise bonuses
4. **Referral XP** (4-5 hours) - Growth mechanic
5. **Monthly Leaderboard Prizes** (2 hours) - Competitive stakes

All validated by: *"Combine bonuses. The more incentives someone has to start and stick, the better."*
