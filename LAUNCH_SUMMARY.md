## WHY THIS WORKS

**Price Anchoring:**
- $1 trial makes $25 feel reasonable
- "Locked in forever" = loyalty incentive
- Reciprocity: $1 for $438 value = they feel indebted

**Real Scarcity:**
- Only 1,000 spots (close cart after)
- Can't onboard unlimited customers
- Creates FOMO

**Real Urgency:**
- Launch window (7-14 days total)
- Cart closes when full
- Price goes up after
- Last 24hr = 50-60% of sales

**Anti-Guarantee:**
- No refund abuse (credits consumable)
- Easy cancel = confidence
- Filters for serious users

**Warm Traffic:**
- 80K followers = built-in demand
- 25K affiliates = distribution
- Converts 10-50x better than ads

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

2. **Real Urgency** - Stick to timeline (no delays)

4. **No Tricks** - Easy cancel in 1 click (build trust)
5. **Leverage Warm** - Use 80K followers first (not paid ads)

## ANTI-GUARANTEE POSITIONING

**On Checkout:**
> "If your first edit isn't your best car photo ever, cancel in 1 click."

**In FAQ:**
> **Q: What's your refund policy?**
> 
> All credit purchases are final (they're consumableâ€”like gas or movie tickets). Once you edit a photo, we've paid for the AI compute.
> 
> BUT you can cancel your subscription anytime in 1 click. No calls, no hassle.

**On Terms:**
> **Refund Policy:** Credits are consumable digital goods and cannot be refunded once used. Subscriptions can be canceled anytime from your dashboard in 1 click.

**Why It Works:**
- Honest (credits ARE consumable)
- Easy cancel = confidence
- No abuse (can't spend then refund)
- Filters quality customers
