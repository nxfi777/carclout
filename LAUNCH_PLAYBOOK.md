## FAQ (Anti-Guarantee)

**Q: What's your refund policy?**
> All credit purchases are final. Credits are consumable‚Äîonce you edit a photo, we've paid for the AI compute. We can't "un-edit" your photos.
> 
> BUT you can cancel your subscription anytime in 1 click. No calls, no hassle.

**Q: What if I don't like it?**
> You get 250 edits for $1. Make 10 edits in your first week. If you're not blown away, cancel in 1 click from your dashboard. You're out $1. That's it.

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
> Yes. 1 click from your dashboard. No retention team, no phone calls, no hoops. We only want customers who love us.

**Q: What happens to my credits if I cancel?**
> Unused credits stay active until your billing period ends. You have time to use them before access expires.

**Q: Is the $25/mo price locked in forever?**
> Yes. If you join during the $1 trial launch, you lock in $25/mo for life. We won't raise your price as long as you stay subscribed.

**Q: What if I miss the 1,000 spots?**
> Price goes to $25/mo (no trial). Or join the waitlist for next cohort (no pricing guarantee).
