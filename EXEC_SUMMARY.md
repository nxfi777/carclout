## THE OPPORTUNITY

**Current State:**
- SaaS product ready (AI photo/video editor for car enthusiasts)
- 80K Instagram followers (warm audience)
- 25K affiliate partners (distribution network)
- $0 revenue (pre-launch)

**The Play:**
- Waitlist launch campaign
- "First 1,000 get $1 trial, then $25/mo forever"
- Close cart after 1,000 spots (real scarcity)
- Leverage warm audience (not paid ads)

**Expected Outcome:**
- 1,000 customers in 30 days
- $18,750-25,000 MRR by Month 2
- $210K-600K ARR Year 1
- Customer acquisition cost: $0-10 vs $50-100 industry

---

## THE OFFER

**Headline:**
> "Be the first of 1,000 to get CarClout for $1. After that, it's $25/month forever."

**What They Get:**
- 250 AI edits/month
- All editing tools (carbon fiber, stance, video, effects)
- Private community (80K+ builders)
- 100GB cloud storage
- XP rewards system (earn free credits)

**Value:** $438/month | **Price:** $1 trial, then $25/mo

**Anti-Guarantee:**
> "If your first edit isn't your best car photo ever, cancel in 1 click."

**Why No Refunds:** Credits are consumable (like gas or movie tickets). Once used, AI compute costs are incurred. But canceling subscription is effortless (1 click, no calls, no hassle).
