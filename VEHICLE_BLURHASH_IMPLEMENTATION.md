# Vehicle Photo BlurHash Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds blurhash support for user profile vehicle photos, providing smooth placeholder images when templates are opened. Vehicle images now display a blurhash placeholder while loading, matching the existing functionality for workspace library images and videos.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`lib/vehicle-photo.ts`)
- Added `VehiclePhoto` type to store vehicle photo metadata
- Includes: `key`, `email`, `blurhash`, `width`, `height`, `size`, `created`, `lastModified`
- Database table: `vehicle_photo` (similar to `library_image`)

### 2. Upload Endpoint (`app/api/storage/upload/route.ts`)
- Updated to automatically generate blurhashes when vehicle photos are uploaded
- Stores metadata in `vehicle_photo` table for photos in `vehicles/` folders
- Non-fatal: Upload succeeds even if blurhash generation fails

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Fetch Vehicle Blurhashes (`app/api/storage/vehicle-blurhashes/route.ts`)
- `POST /api/storage/vehicle-blurhashes`
- Accepts: `{ keys: string[] }`
- Returns: `{ blurhashes: Record<string, { blurhash: string; width: number; height: number }> }`
- Fetches blurhashes for multiple vehicle photos in bulk

#### Backfill Endpoint (`app/api/storage/generate-vehicle-blurhash-backfill/route.ts`)
- `POST /api/storage/generate-vehicle-blurhash-backfill`
- Accepts: `{ key: string }`
- Returns: `{ success: boolean; blurhash?: string; width?: number; height?: number }`
- Generates and stores blurhash for existing vehicle photos without blurhashes

### 4. UI Component (`components/ui/content-tabs-core.tsx`)
- Updated `TemplatesTabContent` to fetch vehicle photo blurhashes when loading
- Replaced `<img>` tags with `BlurhashImage` component for vehicle photos
- Automatic backfill: Detects and generates blurhashes for photos without them
- Shows blurhash placeholder while vehicle photo loads
- Smooth fade-in transition when image is ready

## Database Setup

### Prerequisites
Make sure your SurrealDB instance is running and accessible.

### Run Migration

Execute the following command to create the `vehicle_photo` table:

```bash
surreal sql --endpoint http://localhost:8000 --namespace <ns> --database <db> --auth-level root --user root --pass root < carclout/scripts/setup-vehicle-photo-table.surql
```

Or manually execute in SurrealDB:

```sql
DEFINE TABLE vehicle_photo SCHEMAFULL;
DEFINE FIELD key ON vehicle_photo TYPE string ASSERT $value != NONE;
DEFINE FIELD email ON vehicle_photo TYPE string ASSERT $value != NONE;
DEFINE FIELD blurhash ON vehicle_photo TYPE option<string>;
DEFINE FIELD width ON vehicle_photo TYPE option<number>;
DEFINE FIELD height ON vehicle_photo TYPE option<number>;
DEFINE FIELD size ON vehicle_photo TYPE option<number>;
DEFINE FIELD created ON vehicle_photo TYPE option<datetime>;
DEFINE FIELD lastModified ON vehicle_photo TYPE option<datetime>;
DEFINE INDEX unique_key_email_vehicle ON vehicle_photo FIELDS key, email UNIQUE;
```

## How It Works

### New Vehicle Photo Upload Flow

1. User uploads a vehicle photo via profile settings
2. Photo is uploaded to R2 storage at `users/{userId}/vehicles/{vehicleSlug}/{filename}`
3. **New**: BlurHash is generated from the uploaded image
4. **New**: Metadata (blurhash, dimensions, size) stored in `vehicle_photo` table
5. Photo appears in user's vehicle gallery with blurhash support

### Template Opening Flow

1. User opens a template to generate content
2. Template UI fetches user profile and vehicle photo keys
3. **New**: Vehicle photo blurhashes are fetched in bulk via `/api/storage/vehicle-blurhashes`
4. Vehicle photos are displayed with `BlurhashImage` component
5. While photo loads from R2, blurhash placeholder is shown
6. When photo data is ready, smooth fade-in transition to actual image

### Automatic Backfilling

**Existing vehicle photos are automatically backfilled!**

When users open templates and view their vehicle photos, the system automatically:

1. **Detects** vehicle photos without blurhashes
2. **Generates** blurhashes asynchronously in the background
3. **Updates** the UI in real-time as blurhashes are generated
4. **Processes** photos one at a time (500ms delay) to avoid server overload

#### How It Works

- Runs automatically when opening templates and viewing vehicle photos
- Non-blocking - doesn't affect user experience
- Progress logged to console: `[vehicle-blurhash-backfill]`
- Each photo attempted only once per session
- Works seamlessly alongside existing photos

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Vehicle photos appeared blank/white while loading
- No visual feedback during image load
- Jarring transition when image appears

### After
- Smooth blurhash placeholder immediately visible
- Maintains aspect ratio and color tone while loading
- Elegant fade-in transition when image is ready
- Professional, polished UX matching modern standards

## Error Handling

All blurhash generation is **non-fatal**:
- If blurhash generation fails during upload, photo is still saved successfully
- If blurhash fetch fails, photo displays with fallback gradient placeholder
- If backfill fails, photo still displays normally without blurhash
- Errors are logged but don't block the main operation

## Testing

1. **Upload a new vehicle photo** → Profile settings → Add vehicle → Upload photos → Check template view for blurhash placeholder
2. **Open template with existing photos** → Verify blurhash is displayed while loading → Verify smooth fade-in
3. **Existing photos without blurhash** → Open template → Check console for backfill logs → Verify blurhashes appear
4. **Multiple vehicle photos** → Open template → Verify all photos show blurhashes → Check smooth loading

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `carclout/lib/vehicle-photo.ts` - VehiclePhoto type definition
- `carclout/scripts/setup-vehicle-photo-table.surql` - Database migration script
- `carclout/app/api/storage/vehicle-blurhashes/route.ts` - Bulk blurhash fetch endpoint
- `carclout/app/api/storage/generate-vehicle-blurhash-backfill/route.ts` - Backfill endpoint
- `carclout/VEHICLE_BLURHASH_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
- `carclout/app/api/storage/upload/route.ts` - Added blurhash generation for vehicle photos
- `carclout/components/ui/content-tabs-core.tsx` - Updated UI with BlurhashImage component and backfill logic

## Technical Details

### Storage Structure

Vehicle photos are stored in R2 at:
```
users/{userId}/vehicles/{vehicleSlug}/{filename}
```

### Database Schema

```typescript
type VehiclePhoto = {
  id?: string;
  key: string;              // R2 storage key
  email: string;            // Owner email
  blurhash?: string;        // Generated blurhash string
  width?: number;           // Image width in pixels
  height?: number;          // Image height in pixels
  size?: number;            // File size in bytes
  created?: string;         // ISO 8601 timestamp
  lastModified?: string;    // ISO 8601 timestamp
};
```

### BlurHash Generation

- Component size: 4x3 (width x height)
- Generated server-side using `generateBlurHash` utility
- Uses `sharp` for image processing
- Typically completes in < 100ms per image

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add blurhash to chat profile photos
- [ ] Batch backfill endpoint for admin operations
- [ ] Progress indicator in UI for backfill process
- [ ] Cache blurhashes in sessionStorage alongside URLs
- [ ] Consider adding blur hash to user avatar images

## Performance Considerations

- Blurhash generation adds ~50-100ms to upload time (non-blocking)
- Bulk fetch endpoint is efficient for multiple photos
- Backfill runs asynchronously without impacting UX
- 500ms delay between backfill requests prevents server overload
- Blurhash data is small (~30-50 characters per image)

## Compatibility

- Works with all image formats supported by `sharp` (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, etc.)
- Compatible with existing vehicle photo storage structure
- No changes required to existing user data or R2 structure
- Backwards compatible: Photos without blurhashes still display normally
