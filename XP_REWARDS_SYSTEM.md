# XP Rewards & Gamification System

## Overview

A comprehensive XP-to-credits reward system that encourages daily engagement and community participation through gamification.

## Core Mechanics

### XP Earning

| Activity | Base XP | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Daily Login | 20 XP | Once per day |
| Chat Message | 1 XP | Per message in showroom (max 100 XP/day = 100 messages) |
| Showroom Post (with image) | 50 XP | Bonus for sharing Ignition edits (50Ã— chat value) |
| **First Showroom Post** | **100 XP** | **One-time milestone bonus** |

### Streak Multiplier ðŸ”¥

- **7+ day streak** â†’ **2Ã— XP on all activities**
- Applies to: daily login, chat messages, and showroom posts
- Example: Daily login becomes 40 XP, showroom post becomes 100 XP

### XP to Credits Conversion

- **1,000 XP = 100 credits** (1 free image edit)
- **13,500 XP = 1,350 credits** (1 free video edit)

Users redeem XP for credits on the **Billing page** (`/dashboard/billing`).

## Anti-Spam & Rate Limiting

### Chat Message Protection
- **Daily Limit**: Max 100 XP per day from chat messages (100 messages at 1 XP each)
- **Purpose**: Prevents users from spamming chat for unlimited XP
- **Tracking**: Uses `xp_log` table to track daily chat XP per user
- **User Experience**: Silent rate limit (users can still chat, just don't earn XP after cap)

### XP Activity Logging
All XP gains are logged to `xp_log` table with:
- `user` (RecordId)
- `amount` (XP awarded)
- `reason` (daily-login, chat-message, showroom-post)
- `day` (date key for aggregation)
- `created_at` (timestamp)
