## Executive Brief

*Read time: 5 minutes*

---

## THE SITUATION

**What we have:**
- Working product (AI photo editor for car enthusiasts)
- 80K Instagram followers
- 25K affiliate partners
- Currently $0 revenue (pre-launch)

**The opportunity:**
- Launch with waitlist campaign in 30 days
- Hit $20K monthly revenue by Month 2
- Scale to $500K+ annual revenue Year 1
- Profit margin: 70%+

---

## THE LAUNCH STRATEGY

### The Offer
**"First 1,000 Get It for $1. After That, $25/Month Forever."**

**What customers get:**
- 250 AI edits per month
- All tools (carbon fiber, effects, video)
- Private community access
- Cloud storage

**Anti-guarantee:**
> "If your first edit isn't your best car photo ever, cancel in 1 click."

(No refunds on credits—they're consumable like gas. But canceling subscription is effortless.)

---

### Why This Works

**Price Anchoring:** $1 trial makes $25 feel cheap
**Real Scarcity:** Close cart at 1,000 (creates FOMO)
**Warm Audience:** 80K followers convert 10-50x better than ads
**Low CAC:** $0-10 customer acquisition vs $50-100 industry

---

### 30-Day Timeline

**Week 1-2:** Build waitlist page, write emails, prep content
**Week 3:** Tease on Instagram ("something's coming...")
**Week 4:** Open waitlist → Launch → Close at 1,000 spots

---

## REVENUE PROJECTIONS

- Target: 75-80% retention (industry: 60-70%)

**Risk #3: High churn**
- Mitigation: Cancellation save flows, community engagement
- Target: <5% monthly (industry: 10-15%)

- Easy cancel = confidence without exposure
